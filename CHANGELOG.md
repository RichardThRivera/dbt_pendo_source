## Bug Fixes
- **For Snowflake warehouses:** Addressed issue [#6](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pendo/issues/6), in which users were seeing reserved keyword-related errors when the package selected from the source `GROUP` table. The package now incorporates appropriate quoting and casing for this table in Snowflake destinations. Thanks to both @leinemann and @payzer-mike for contributing!
